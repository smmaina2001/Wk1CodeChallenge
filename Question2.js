/* 
Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

/* In the question above we have been asked to write a fuction whose input is speed and the output is to print the demerit points based on the speed.
The solution comprises of:
a. A switch statement with various cases based on speed.The switch is a boolean value of true if the speed is within the specified limit.
b. Within the cases, there are relative comparison operators which give a speed range
c. After the cases, we want to print the result hence the use of console.log
d. After every case there is a break which is used to stop the switch from continuing to look at other case statements once it finds a match.
e. There is a default statement which is the last result if the switch statement does not find a match.

// To test the above so that we know whether it will print the correct demerit points, lets use the following arguments:
